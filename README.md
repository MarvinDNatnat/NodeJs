This Readme provides a brief overview of important concepts and libraries commonly used in Node.js development. It covers topics such as CORS, JWT token authentication, Swagger for API documentation, Socket.io for real-time communication, PM2 for process management, Node Cron for scheduled tasks, and Express for building web applications.


  <h3>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)</h3>
CORS is a mechanism that allows resources (e.g., APIs) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. To enable CORS in a Node.js application, you can use the cors middleware package.

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install cors
  ```
  
  
  <h3>JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication</h3>
JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a popular way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are often used for authentication and authorization purposes. The jsonwebtoken package is commonly used to generate and verify JWTs in Node.js.

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install jsonwebtoken
  ```
  
  <h3>Swagger</h3>
Swagger is an open-source toolset for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and testing APIs. In Node.js, the swagger-ui-express package can be used to integrate Swagger into your Express application.
  
  * npm
  ```sh
  npm install swagger-ui-express
  ```
  
  
 <h3>Socket.io</h3>
Socket.io is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers. It allows you to build applications with features like chat, notifications, and collaborative functionality. To use Socket.io in your Node.js application, you need to install the socket.io package.
  
  * npm
  ```sh
  npm install socket.io
  ```
  
  
  <h3>PM2 (Process Manager)</h3>
PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications. It allows you to manage application processes, perform zero-downtime deployments, and monitor application health. PM2 provides various features like clustering, load balancing, and log management. To use PM2, you can install it globally using npm.
  * npm
  ```sh
  npm install pm2 -g
  ```
  
  <h3>Node Cron</h3>
Node Cron is a library that allows you to schedule recurring tasks in your Node.js applications using cron syntax. It provides a simple way to execute code at specified intervals. To use Node Cron, you can install the node-cron package.
  
  * npm
  ```sh
  npm install node-cron
  ```
  
  <h3>Express</h3>
Express is a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs. To use Express, you can install the express package.
  
  * npm
  ```sh
  npm install express
  ```
